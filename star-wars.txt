The Star Wars saga primarily revolves around the struggle between the Galactic Republic
(and later the Rebel Alliance/New Republic) and the totalitarian Galactic Empire.
Key characters include Luke Skywalker, a powerful Jedi who ultimately defeats the Emperor,
and his father, Darth Vader (formerly Anakin Skywalker).
Darth Vader is recognizable by his iconic black armor and breathing apparatus.
The primary conflict began with the Clone Wars, which saw the Jedi Knights lead an army of 
clone troopers against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
The clones were bred on the planet Kamino.
The war ended with the rise of the Empire.
The Death Star was the Empire's ultimate weapon, a spherical battle station with the ability to destroy an entire planet.
The first Death Star was destroyed by Luke Skywalker during the Battle of Yavin.
Han Solo and his co-pilot Chewbacca famously flew the Millennium Falcon and were instrumental in the Rebel Alliance’s victories. Han Solo
was rescued from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt in the movie Return of the Jedi.
